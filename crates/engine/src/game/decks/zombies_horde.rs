//! Zombies Horde (community format, hordemagic.com) — the decklist for
//! [`crate::types::format::ChallengeDeck::ZombiesHorde`].
//!
//! Data, not logic. 100 non-token cards plus 200 predefined Zombie / Zombie Giant
//! tokens, for a 300-card library — the same shape as the Cyberman Horde.
//!
//! Every card here is a real, already-implemented Magic card (all 38 distinct
//! names resolve against the card DB and none parse to an `Unimplemented`
//! effect), and both tokens are vanilla bodies catalogued at `fidelity = Full`.
//! That makes this deck fully playable on the existing spine — unlike the D&D
//! Horde, whose Ooze token needs a triggered ability the token primitive cannot
//! yet carry.
//!
//! Wave rule: `WaveTermination::UntilNonToken` with a
//! [`crate::types::format::WaveCount::Snaking`] count of 1..=3. Per the published
//! rules the Horde "will Wave 1, putting out Tokens until it flips its first
//! nontoken card. Then ... Wave 2 ... and so on for Wave 3. On its next turn, it
//! will descend back down to Wave 2, snaking back and forth."

/// The non-token cards, as `(count, exact card name)` pairs. Each name resolves
/// against the runtime card database (`CardDatabase::get_face_by_name`); the
/// injection in `deck_loading::load_horde_library` panics on any name that fails
/// to resolve so a transcription error surfaces immediately.
///
/// 79 creatures + 21 spells/permanents = 100 non-token cards.
