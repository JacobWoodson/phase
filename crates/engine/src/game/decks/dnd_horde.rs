//! D&D Horde (community format, hordemagic.com) — the Level 1 "Ooze" library for
//! [`crate::types::format::ChallengeDeck::DndHorde`].
//!
//! Data, not logic. Unlike the Cyberman Horde (which leans on ~200 predefined,
//! uniquely-named Universes Beyond tokens), the D&D Horde is built almost
//! entirely from real, already-implemented cards, so its coverage is high and it
//! is a good "second deck" proof that the deck-agnostic spine takes a new
//! challenge deck as a pure addition.
//!
//! Wave rule: this deck uses `WaveTermination::UntilRarityAtLeast(Uncommon)` —
//! commons and tokens build the board and the first uncommon-or-better card caps
//! the wave (see `game::horde::maybe_reveal_next`). The per-card rarity that
//! drives that gate is recorded on each library object at load time from the
//! card DB (`deck_loading::create_horde_library_card`).
//!
//! Scope: this module is the **Level 1 Ooze** library (100 cards). The full D&D
//! Horde escalates through three tiered libraries (Ooze → Goblin/Skeleton →
//! Giant/Dragon); multi-tier progression and the deck's homebrew rules (legendary
//! phase-out, post-combat activation) are follow-up slices.

/// The non-token cards, as `(count, exact card name)` pairs. Each name resolves
/// against the runtime card database (`CardDatabase::get_face_by_name`); the
/// injection in `deck_loading::load_horde_library` panics on any name that fails
/// to resolve so a transcription error surfaces immediately.
///
/// 62 non-token cards (+ 38 Ooze tokens = 100).
