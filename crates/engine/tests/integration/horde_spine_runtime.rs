//! Horde Magic spine-runtime integration tests (PR2).
//!
//! These drive the REAL turn/priority/cast pipeline through `GameRunner`:
//!   - the Horde skips its draw step every turn;
//!   - the Horde's precombat main reveals-and-casts a `FixedCount(k)` wave of
//!     nontoken cards, which RESOLVE onto the battlefield under the Horde;
//!   - the game-start emblem grants haste + must-attack to the Horde's
//!     creatures (and not to survivor-controlled creatures);
//!   - a survivor's precombat main fires no wave.
//!
//! Each test names an assertion that flips if the corresponding wiring is
//! reverted (see the per-test doc comments).
