//! Horde Magic PR3 — no-life-total → mill redirect and Horde-variant win/lose.
//!
//! Horde Magic is a casual cooperative variant. The Horde seat (seat 0) has NO
//! life total:
//!   - damage / direct life loss it would suffer instead MILLS that many cards
//!     from the top of its own library (CR 120.3a damage→life-loss and CR 119.3
//!     direct life loss are redirected);
//!   - life gain does nothing to it;
//!   - it is exempt from the CR 704.5a "0 or less life loses" state-based action;
//!   - it is defeated (survivors win) when its library is empty AND it controls
//!     no creature, routed through the existing archenemy game-over path
//!     (CR 104.2a).
//!
//! Every test names an assertion that flips if the corresponding PR3 wiring is
//! reverted (see the per-test doc comments). Negative assertions are paired with
//! a positive reach-guard proving the input reached the seam under test.
